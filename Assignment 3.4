HDFS
1)Provides storage
2)Provides processing capability
It is a java-based file system and is the place where all the data in the Hadoop cluster resides.In typical terms, It is called as Master-Slave
architecture because there is a Master which takes control of all the Slaves. Here the Master is named as Namenodes and the Slaves are named as
Datanodes. The NameNode is the centerpiece of an HDFS file system. It keeps the directory tree of all files in the file system, and tracks where
across the cluster the file data is kept. It does not store the data of these files itself.
Client applications talk to the NameNode whenever they wish to locate a file, or when they want to add/copy/move/delete a file. The NameNode responds
the successful requests by returning a list of relevant DataNode servers where the data lives.
The NameNode is a Single Point of Failure for the HDFS Cluster. HDFS is not currently a High Availability system. When the NameNode goes down, the file
system goes offline. There is an optional SecondaryNameNode that can be hosted on a separate machine. It only creates checkpoints of the namespace by
merging the edits file into the fsimage file and does not provide any real redundancy.
It is essential to look after the NameNode.
Following are some recommendations:
Configure the NameNode to store one set of transaction logs on a separate disk from the image. Configure the NameNode to store another set of 
transaction logs to a network mounted disk. Monitor the disk space available to the NameNode. If free space is getting low, add more storage. Do not host
DataNode, JobTracker or TaskTracker services on the same system. Use a good server with lots of RAM. The more RAM you have, the bigger the file system, or
the smaller the block size.
